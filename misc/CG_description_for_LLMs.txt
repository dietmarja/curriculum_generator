Python Curriculum Generator (CG)
The Python Curriculum Generator (CG) is a modular project designed to generate and export curricula. It aligns with task 3.2 of the Digital4Sustainability project and deliverable D2.1.

Key Features:

Export Formats: Supports exporting curricula to HTML, JSON, PDF, SCORM, and xAPI.
Skill and Role Modeling: Utilizes structured JSON files (e.g., skills.json, roles.json) for modeling skills and professional roles.
Visualization Tools: Includes Sankey diagrams for visualizing data.
Validation and Configuration: Provides utilities for validation and configuration.

Core Components:
Module: Represents a learning unit with attributes such as EQF level, ECTS points, delivery method, skills, outcomes, and prerequisites.
Role: Defines professional profiles with associated skills, EQF levels, assessment methods, and learning outcomes.
Curriculum: Aggregates modules into a full curriculum, calculates total ECTS, organizes modules by semester, and categorizes skills.

Functionality:
CurriculumGenerator: Loads modules and roles from JSON files, generates curricula automatically, and handles missing data gracefully.
Dynamic Semester Assignment: Assigns modules to semesters based on prerequisites.
Skill Categorization: Aligns skills with thematic areas like sustainability or cybersecurity.
HTML Export: Provides built-in HTML export with styled structure and skills visualization.
Extensible Design: Easily integrates with curriculum planners, LMS, or policy tools.
